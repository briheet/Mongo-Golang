This is a project where i have created Golang and MongoDB REST API.
You can find the structure in the models folder and the functions and the methods written in the controllers folder.

To run this Project:

1. Install MongoDB on your systems and fire it up.
2. Run the command ls in the terminal. `cd` into the mongo-golang folder or the shown folder.
3. Run the command go run main.go.
4. If you have any issues you can solve it using Chat Gpt.
5. Open thunder client on vs code. In the body section, send a req on the local server on which you are     serving. You'll get back the data in json format with the unique id.
6. Test all the methods. Happy learning.
